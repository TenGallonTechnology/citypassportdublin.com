Championed by the Friends of the Carnegie, a historic lecture series, educational outreach, and regional art exhibit are featured throughout the year.",

Along with always popular First Friday concerts during the summer, the Market is also home to the annual Farm to Table Dinner, Pig in the Park BBQ, and the Chili Cook-off and Fall Festival. It is the gathering place downtown for outdoor live music, food, art, and family fun."
